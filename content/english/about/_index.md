faqs:
  - question: Who is behind Proper Access?
    answer: Proper Access was founded by Julia Tol, one of the experts in digital accessibility, with 8 years of experience in audits, consulting, and training. The team consists of 6 auditors whom we have trained ourselves. We are a strong technical team with a great passion for our profession and strong social engagement.
  - question: What is your mission?
    answer: We strive to be the best in everything we do. We make digital accessibility the standard. For everyone. We help organizations make their websites, apps, and digital services accessible — not as a checkbox exercise, but as an improvement for everyone.
  - question: What sets you apart from other audit agencies?
    answer: Take a look at our reports. We know what it feels like to receive an accessibility report as a client. We are not an inspection body that only rejects. We want to make digital accessibility easier and more understandable for you.
  - question: How do you stay up to date with guidelines and technology?
    answer: We closely follow international developments in the field of WCAG, EAA, and digital inclusion, and actively participate in professional groups, networks, and knowledge-sharing initiatives.
