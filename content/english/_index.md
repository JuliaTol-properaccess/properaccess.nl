faqs:
  - question: "What does a digital accessibility audit cost?"
    answer: "That depends on the size and type of your site. During an introduction call, we immediately provide a clear estimate."
  - question: "Do we need to fix everything right away?"
    answer: "No. We help you prioritize. For each issue, we indicate the impact: minor, moderate, or severe."
  - question: "Is digital accessibility mandatory?"
    answer: "Yes, for government organizations and companies above a certain size. And even if you’re not (yet) covered by the EAA, it prevents complaints and positions you as an inclusive organization."
  - question: "What if we’re not technical?"
    answer: "No problem. We translate everything into clear, understandable language – and we also work directly with your developers or content team."
